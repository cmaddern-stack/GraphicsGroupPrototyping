# GraphicsGroupPrototyping
A repo for COMP30019 - game prototyping and exploration. A chance to work together and flesh out ideas before the real assignment.

## Initial Prototype Idea Planning

 - [ ] First person movement and camera
 - [ ] Generic Kinematic Body Block placement with a raycast.
 - [ ] Ability to hold, move, and release objects
 - [ ] Blocks that interact with each other on collision (eg. explode apart) and surrounding (ideally clean) architecture
